# @umpire/store

## 1.0.0

### Patch Changes

- cb926d7: Fix `fromStore` condition handling by removing the unsafe `undefined as unknown as C` cast and passing `undefined` when no `conditions` selector is provided.
- fee01cf: code formatting & type adjustments for better consistency
- 82fdd4b: Clean up duplicated internals across adapters and JSON tooling by sharing guards, JSON clone helpers, and store previous-state tracking, while simplifying reactive and snapshot plumbing.

  Also tighten package metadata by marking `react` as an optional peer for `@umpire/devtools`.

- 4eecbeb: Loosen `InputValues` from a generic `FieldValues<F>` alias to `Record<string, unknown>`. Consumer call sites (`check()`, `play()`, `useUmpire()`, adapters) no longer require casts when passing form state or dynamic records. Predicate callbacks keep `FieldValues<F>` for typed field access. Remove phantom `F` parameter from `Snapshot` — only `C` (conditions) is structurally used.
- 4d8bd6c: adjusted publishing setup for `.claude` rules (i don't even honestly know if this kind of thing works. hopefully it's helpful!)
